description: "The AI Policy Layer for Agentic Ecosystems"
---

Limits intercepts every agentic action at the edge, centralizes and versions stateful policies, and replaces prompt-driven constraints with deterministic rules.

## Why Limits?

When building AI agents, you need guardrails that are reliable, auditable, and don't depend on prompt engineering. Limits provides a policy layer that sits between your agents and their actions, ensuring every operation follows your defined rules.

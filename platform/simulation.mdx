description: "Test policies with sample payloads before deployment"

Test policies before deployment to ensure they work as expected.

## Testing Policies with Sample Payloads

1. Open a policy in the editor
2. Navigate to the "Simulate" tab in the right sidebar
3. Enter a sample payload (JSON format)
4. Click "Evaluate" to see how the policy processes the payload

## Quick Test Templates

The simulator provides quick templates for common scenarios:

- **Basic Request**: Simple request with amount and user
- **High-Value Transaction**: Large amount transaction
- **High-Risk User**: Request from high-risk user profile
- **Custom**: Create your own payload

## Custom Payload Input

Enter any JSON payload to test:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "user-123",
    "risk_level": "high",
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

## Evaluation Trace Visualization

After evaluation, you'll see:

- **Decision**: Allow, Block, or Escalate
- **Matched Conditions**: Which conditions evaluated to true
- **Evaluation Steps**: Step-by-step trace of the evaluation
- **Execution Time**: How long the evaluation took

## Simulation History

- Previous simulations are saved in the history
- Re-run previous simulations
- Compare results across different payloads

## Unit Tests Display

View and manage unit tests for the policy:

- Predefined test cases
- Expected outcomes
- Run all tests to validate policy behavior

## Real-time Condition Evaluation

As you modify conditions, you can:

- Test immediately with the current payload
- See how changes affect the evaluation
- Iterate quickly to refine your policy

Connect Limits with third-party services to extend functionality and receive notifications.

## Available Integrations Overview

Currently supported integrations:

- **Slack**: Team communication and notifications
- **Webhooks**: Custom HTTP endpoints

More integrations are planned for future releases.

## Slack Integration

### Installation and Setup

1. Navigate to the Integrations page
2. Find the Slack integration card
3. Click the toggle or "Connect" button
4. You'll be redirected to Slack for authorization
5. Select the Slack workspace to connect
6. Authorize the integration
7. You'll be redirected back to Limits

### Channel Selection

After connecting Slack:

1. Open a policy in the editor
2. Navigate to the Notifications section
3. Select Slack as a notification provider
4. Choose which Slack channels should receive notifications
5. Configure channels separately for Allow, Block, and Escalate actions

### Notification Configuration

Slack notifications include:

- Policy name and key
- Action taken (Allow/Block/Escalate)
- Request details
- Evaluation reason
- Timestamp

### Testing Integration

1. Use the policy simulation feature
2. Trigger a policy evaluation
3. Check your configured Slack channels
4. Verify notifications are received correctly

### Integration Status Management

On the Integrations page:

- **Active**: Integration is connected and working
- **Inactive**: Integration is disconnected
- **Error**: Integration has an error (check configuration)

Toggle integrations on/off as needed. Disconnecting an integration doesn't delete the configuration, so you can reconnect later.

## Webhook Notifications

Send HTTP requests to configured endpoints:

- **Webhook URL**: Endpoint to receive notifications
- **HTTP Method**: Typically POST
- **Payload**: JSON containing request and policy information

### Webhook Payload Structure

```json
{
  "action": "allow|block|escalate",
  "policy_id": "policy-id",
  "request": { /* original request payload */ },
  "reason": "Condition matched: request.amount > 1000",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-26T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Conditions determine when specific actions (Allow, Block, Escalate) are triggered.

## Condition Operators

The following operators are available for building conditions:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` or `==` | Equals | `user.risk_level == 'high'` |
| `!=` | Not equals | `request.amount != 0` |
| `<` | Less than | `request.amount < 1000` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal | `request.amount <= 1000` |
| `>` | Greater than | `request.amount > 1000` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal | `request.amount >= 1000` |
| `contains` | String contains | `user.country contains 'US'` |
| `null` | Is null/undefined | `user.risk_level null` |
| `notNull` | Is not null | `user.risk_level notNull` |

## Field Path Selection

Field paths reference data in the request payload:

- Use dot notation: `request.amount`, `user.country`
- Access nested objects: `request.payment.method`
- Reference arrays: `request.items[0].price`

**Common field paths:**
- `request.amount` - Request amount/value
- `request.currency` - Currency code
- `user.id` - User identifier
- `user.risk_level` - User risk assessment
- `user.country` - User's country

## Logical Operators

Combine multiple conditions:

- **AND (`&&`)**: All conditions must be true
- **OR (`||`)**: At least one condition must be true

**Example:**
```
request.amount > 1000 && user.risk_level == 'high'
```

## Parentheses Grouping

Use parentheses to control evaluation order:

```
(request.amount > 1000 || request.amount < 0) && user.verified == true
```

## Action Priority

When multiple conditions match, actions are prioritized:

1. **Block** (highest priority) - If any block condition matches, the request is blocked
2. **Escalate** - If block doesn't match but escalate does, request is escalated
3. **Allow** (lowest priority) - If neither block nor escalate match, allow condition is checked

<Warning>
Block conditions are always evaluated first, regardless of the order they appear in the policy.
</Warning>

## Condition Expression Generation

Conditions are automatically converted to expressions:

- The visual condition builder generates condition expressions
- You can view the generated expression in the expression editor
- Condition expressions are evaluated against request payloads

**Example condition expression:**
```
request.amount > 1000 && user.risk_level == "high"
```

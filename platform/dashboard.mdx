The Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your platform's activity and key metrics.

## Overview Statistics

The dashboard displays four key metrics in stat cards:

### Active Policies

- Number of currently active policies
- Policies that are actively enforcing rules

### Pending Approval

- Number of requests awaiting review (escalated)
- These are requests that have been escalated for manual approval

### Rejected

- Total number of blocked/declined requests
- Requests that were rejected by policies

### Approved

- Total number of allowed/completed requests
- Requests that passed policy evaluation

## Charts and Visualizations

### Reviewer Workload Area Chart

The dashboard includes an interactive area chart showing:

- **Requests over time** - Visual representation of request volume
- **Trend analysis** - Identify patterns in your request flow
- **Time-based filtering** - View data for different time periods

The chart updates in real-time and provides insights into your platform's usage patterns.

## Real-time Data Updates

- Dashboard data refreshes automatically every 60 seconds
- Statistics are cached for 30 seconds to optimize performance
- Manual refresh is available if needed

## Understanding Metrics

- **Active Policies**: Policies with status set to "active" are currently enforcing rules
- **Pending Approvals**: Requests that match "escalate" conditions require review in Approvals
- **Rejected/Approved**: These metrics reflect the outcomes of policy evaluations

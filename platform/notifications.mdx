Configure notifications to be sent when policy actions are taken.

## Webhook Notifications

Send HTTP requests to configured endpoints:

- **Webhook URL**: Endpoint to receive notifications
- **HTTP Method**: Typically POST
- **Payload**: JSON containing request and policy information

### Webhook Payload Structure

```json
{
  "action": "allow|block|escalate",
  "policy_id": "policy-id",
  "request": { /* original request payload */ },
  "reason": "Condition matched: request.amount > 1000",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-26T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Per-Action Notification Configuration

Configure notifications separately for each action:

- **Allow Notifications**: Sent when requests are allowed
- **Block Notifications**: Sent when requests are blocked
- **Escalate Notifications**: Sent when requests are escalated

Each action can have:

- Multiple webhook endpoints
- Independent enable/disable settings

## Notification Setup and Management

1. Open a policy in the editor
2. Navigate to the action tab (Allow, Block, or Escalate)
3. Scroll to the Notifications section
4. Enable notifications for the action
5. Add webhook URLs
6. Save the policy

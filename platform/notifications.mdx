Configure notifications to be sent when policy actions are taken.

## Webhook Notifications

Send HTTP requests to configured endpoints:

- **Webhook URL**: Endpoint to receive notifications
- **HTTP Method**: Typically POST
- **Payload**: JSON containing request and policy information

### Webhook Payload Structure

```json
{
  "action": "allow|block|escalate",
  "policy_id": "policy-id",
  "request": { /* original request payload */ },
  "reason": "Condition matched: request.amount > 1000",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-26T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Per-Action Notification Configuration

Configure notifications separately for each action:

- **Allow Notifications**: Sent when requests are allowed
- **Block Notifications**: Sent when requests are blocked
- **Escalate Notifications**: Sent when requests are escalated

Each action can have:

- Multiple webhook endpoints
- Independent enable/disable settings

2. Navigate to the action tab (Allow, Block, or Escalate)
3. Scroll to the Notifications section
4. Enable notifications for the action

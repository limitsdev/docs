Policies are the core of the Limits platform. They define rules that determine how requests are processed.

## Policy Overview and Concepts

A policy consists of:

- **Policy Key**: Unique identifier for the policy
- **Tags**: Labels for organizing and categorizing policies
- **Status**: Active or Inactive
- **Default Action**: What happens when no conditions match (Allow, Block, or Escalate)
- **Conditions**: Rules that determine when to apply specific actions
- **Locks**: Rate limiting and time-based restrictions
- **Notifications**: Alerts sent when actions are taken

## Creating Policies via AI Assistant

The easiest way to create a policy is using the AI Assistant:

1. Navigate to the Assistant page (accessible from the sidebar or by going to `/assistant`)
2. Enter your policy requirements in natural language
3. The AI will process your request and generate a policy configuration
4. Review and refine the generated policy
5. Deploy the policy when ready

**Example queries:**
- "Block all transactions over $10,000"
- "Allow up to 5 requests per hour per user"
- "Escalate requests from high-risk users for manual review"

## Policy Editing

Policies can be edited in two modes:

### Conditions Mode

Visual condition builder for creating policies:

- Build conditions using a visual interface
- Select field paths, operators, and values
- Combine conditions with logical operators
- See real-time CEL expression generation

### Instructions Mode

Natural language input for policy creation:

- Describe policies in plain English
- AI generates the policy configuration
- Continue conversation to refine the policy

## Policy Structure

### Policy Key and Tags

- **Policy Key**: Must be unique across your organization
- **Tags**: Add multiple tags to organize policies (e.g., "payment", "fraud-prevention", "high-priority")

### Default Action

When no conditions match, the default action is applied:

- **ALLOW**: Request is approved
- **BLOCK**: Request is rejected
- **ESCALATE**: Request is sent for human approval

### Condition Logic (CEL Expressions)

Policies use CEL (Common Expression Language) for condition evaluation:

- Conditions are evaluated against incoming request payloads
- Multiple conditions can be combined with logical operators
- Each action (Allow, Block, Escalate) can have its own set of conditions

### Lock Mechanisms

Three types of locks can be applied:

1. **Limit Lock**: Rate limiting based on count or budget
2. **Time Window Lock**: Restrict actions to specific days and times
3. **Velocity Lock**: Detect rapid request patterns

### Notifications

Configure notifications for each action:

- **Slack**: Send notifications to Slack channels
- **Webhooks**: Send HTTP requests to configured endpoints

## Policy Status

- **Active**: Policy is currently enforcing rules
- **Inactive**: Policy is disabled and not evaluating requests

Toggle policy status from the policy editor or policies list.

## Policy Deployment

After creating or editing a policy:

1. Review all settings (conditions, locks, notifications)
2. Test the policy using the simulation feature
3. Click "Deploy" to save and activate the policy
4. The policy will immediately start evaluating requests

## Policy Search and Filtering

On the Policies page, you can:

- **Search by key**: Use the search box to find policies by their key
- **Filter by status**: Show only active or inactive policies
- **Clear filters**: Reset all filters to view all policies

## Policy Pagination

- Policies are paginated for better performance
- Default page size is 10 policies per page
- Navigate between pages using pagination controls
- Adjust page size if needed

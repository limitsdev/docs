Policies are the core of the Limits platform. They define rules that determine whether each request is **allowed**, **blocked**, or **escalated**. You create policies from the **New Policy** button, choose **Conditions** or **Instructions** mode, and the AI Assistant generates the policy. You then edit, simulate, deploy, and manage all policies from the **Policies** page.

## How the platform flow works

Creating and managing a policy follows this flow:

1. **Trigger** — Click **New Policy** (in the page header), describe your policy in natural language, choose **Conditions** or **Instructions** mode, and submit.
2. **Assistant** — You are taken to the Assistant page (`/assistant/conditions` or `/assistant/instructions`). The AI streams: *Processing your request → Analyzing requirements → Generating policy configuration → Finalizing*. When done, you see the **Results area** (left) and **Simulation sidebar** (right).
3. **Result by mode** — What you see in the policy tabs depends on the mode you chose:
   - **Conditions mode** — Allow / Block / Escalate tabs with structured rules (CEL and condition builder).
   - **Instructions mode** — An Instructions tab with natural language. Same options for notifications.
   - **Guardrail mode** — A guardrails schema (PII, moderation, jailbreak, etc.). See [Guardrails](/platform/guardrails).
4. **Edit, simulate, deploy** — You can edit the policy (key, tags, default action, conditions or instructions), run **Simulation** with a JSON payload, and **Deploy** (or rely on auto-save) to save the policy.
5. **Policies list** — Open **Policies** from the sidebar to see all policies in a table: search by key, filter by status, and edit or delete.

## Creating a policy (New Policy)

### Step 1: Open the Create Policy dialog

- From the **Policies** page (or any page that shows the header with **New Policy**), click **New Policy**.
- A dialog opens with a text area and a mode selector.

### Step 2: Describe your policy and choose mode

- **Describe** your policy in plain language (e.g. *"Limit Stripe payments to $1000 per day"* or *"Allow maximum 100 API requests per minute"*).
- **Choose mode:** **Conditions** (structured rules), **Instructions** (natural language), or **Guardrail** (content safety, PII, moderation). You cannot mix modes in one policy.
- **Submit** with Enter or the arrow button.

### Step 3: Assistant generates the policy

- You are navigated to **`/assistant/conditions`**, **`/assistant/instructions`**, or **`/assistant/guardrail`** depending on your choice.
- The Assistant streams four steps: *Processing your request* → *Analyzing requirements* → *Generating policy configuration* → *Finalizing*.
- When streaming finishes, the view switches to a **split layout**:
  - **Left (Results area):** Policy header (status, deploy), policy config (key, tags, default action), **policy tabs** (content depends on mode), use cases, and simulation.
  - **Right:** Simulation sidebar (chat + payload editor + run simulation + history).

### Step 4: Review and refine

- **Conditions mode:** Edit the Allow / Block / Escalate tabs (CEL, condition builder), add notifications per action.
- **Instructions mode:** Edit the natural-language instructions in the Instructions tab; same notifications.
- Use **Simulation** to send a test payload and see allow/block/escalate (or error). Adjust the policy as needed.
- Click **Deploy** (or **Update**) to save. The policy is stored and appears on the Policies page.

## Policy structure (what you edit)

Every policy has:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Policy key** | Unique identifier (e.g. `amount-minimum-usd`). Required. |
| **Tags** | Labels for organizing (e.g. `payment`, `fraud-prevention`). |
| **Status** | **Active** (enforcing) or **Inactive** (disabled). |
| **Default action** | When no condition matches: **Allow**, **Block**, or **Escalate**. |
| **Policy tabs** | **Conditions mode:** Allow / Block / Escalate tabs with CEL and condition builder. **Instructions mode:** Instructions tab with natural language. **Guardrail mode:** Guardrails schema (PII, moderation, etc.). See [Guardrails](/platform/guardrails). |
| **Notifications** (optional) | Webhooks (and Slack when available) per action. See [Notifications](/platform/notifications). |

## Policies page (`/policies`)

The Policies page is your list and management surface for all policies.

### Header

- **Title:** Policies.
- **New Policy** button — Opens the same Create Policy dialog (describe + mode → Assistant flow).

### Table

- **Columns:** Key, Status, Tags, Default Action, Requires Human Review, Created, Last Updated, Actions (edit, delete).
- **Search:** By policy key (debounced).
- **Filter:** Status = All | Active | Inactive.
- **Pagination:** Page index and page size (e.g. 10 per page).

### Row actions

- **Edit** — Opens the policy edit page (`/policies/{id}/edit`) with the same mode (conditions or instructions) the policy was created with.
- **Delete** — Removes the policy (with confirmation if your app uses it).
- **Edit tags** — Update tags inline or in a dialog.

## Summary: from Create Policy to Policies list

| Step | Where | What you do | Result |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Page header | Click **New Policy**, describe policy, choose **Conditions** or **Instructions**, submit | Dialog closes; navigate to `/assistant/conditions` or `/assistant/instructions` |
| 2 | Assistant page | (Automatic) Your description is sent to the Assistant | Streaming steps → policy config + message |
| 3 | Assistant page | Wait for stream to finish | Split view: Results area (left) + Simulation sidebar (right) |
| 4 | Results area | View/edit by mode | **Conditions:** Allow/Block/Escalate CEL + notifications. **Instructions:** Natural language + same options |
| 5 | Results area | Deploy/Update, Simulate, generate use cases | Policy saved; simulation runs; templates for payloads |
| 6 | Policies page | Open from sidebar or after saving | Table of policies; search, filter, edit, delete |

API keys enable programmatic access to the Limits platform for integration with your applications.

## Generating API Keys

1. Navigate to the API Keys page
2. Click "Generate API Key" button
3. A new API key will be created
4. **Important**: Copy the key immediately - it's only shown once
5. Store the key securely

<Warning>
API keys are only displayed once when created. Make sure to copy and store them securely.
</Warning>

## Viewing API Keys List

The API Keys table displays:

- **Key**: Masked version of the key (for security)
- **Created By**: User who created the key
- **Created**: When the key was created
- **Last Used**: Most recent usage timestamp
- **Status**: Active or Inactive

## API Key Status Management

Toggle API keys between Active and Inactive:

- **Active**: Key can be used for API requests
- **Inactive**: Key is disabled and cannot be used

<Info>
Best Practice: Deactivate unused keys instead of deleting them to maintain audit history.
</Info>

## API Key Security Best Practices

1. **Never share keys**: Keep API keys confidential
2. **Rotate regularly**: Generate new keys periodically
3. **Use environment variables**: Don't hardcode keys in your application
4. **Limit permissions**: Use keys with minimal required permissions
5. **Monitor usage**: Check "Last Used" to detect unauthorized access
6. **Deactivate unused keys**: Disable keys that are no longer needed

## Viewing Key Details

Each API key shows:

- **Created By**: User account that generated the key
- **Created Date**: When the key was first created
- **Last Used**: Most recent API request using this key
- **Status**: Current state (Active/Inactive)

## Using API Keys

Include the API key in your HTTP requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Example:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.limits.dev/policies
```

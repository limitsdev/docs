The Escalations feature enables human review of requests that are escalated by policies.

## Escalation Request Overview

When a policy's escalate condition matches:

1. The request is blocked from automatic processing
2. An escalation request is created
3. The request appears in the Escalations page
4. An authorized user can approve or decline the request

## Viewing Pending Escalations

The Escalations page shows:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the escalation request
- **Policy ID**: Which policy triggered the escalation
- **Created At**: When the approval request was created
- **Status**: Pending, Accepted, or Declined
- **Request**: Details of the original request (amount, currency, etc.)
- **Action By**: User who approved or declined (if completed)

## Approving or Declining Escalations

For pending requests:

1. Review the request details
2. Click "Approve" to allow the request
3. Or click "Decline" to reject the request
4. The action is recorded and the request is processed accordingly

<Info>
Only pending requests can be approved or declined. Completed requests show their final status.

## Escalation Status Tracking

Escalation statuses:

- **PENDING**: Awaiting human review
- **ACCEPTED**: Request was approved by a reviewer
- **DECLINED**: Request was declined by a reviewer

Status badges are color-coded:
- Pending: Gray with clock icon
- Accepted: Green with checkmark
- Declined: Red with X icon

## Understanding Escalation Workflow

1. **Policy Evaluation**: Request matches escalate condition
2. **Approval Request Created**: System creates approval request
3. **Notification**: Reviewer is notified (via Slack, email, etc.)
4. **Review**: Reviewer examines request details
5. **Decision**: Approve or decline
6. **Processing**: Request is processed based on decision
7. **Completion**: Approval request status is updated

## Request Details

Each escalation request shows:

- **Request Amount**: Monetary value of the request
- **Currency**: Currency code
- **Policy Information**: Which policy triggered the escalation
- **Original Request**: Full request payload (expandable)
- **Timestamps**: When created and when action was taken

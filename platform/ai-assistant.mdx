The AI Assistant is a powerful tool that converts natural language descriptions into structured policy configurations.

## Natural Language to Policy Conversion

Simply describe what you want your policy to do, and the AI will:

1. Analyze your requirements
2. Generate appropriate conditions
3. Configure notifications
4. Create a complete policy structure

## Streaming AI Experience

When you submit a query, the AI processes it in real-time:

1. **Processing your request** - Initial analysis begins
2. **Analyzing requirements** - AI understands your intent
3. **Generating policy configuration** - Policy structure is created
4. **Finalizing** - Policy is ready for review

You'll see progress indicators for each step as the AI works.

## Two Creation Modes

### Instructions Mode

Access via `/assistant/instructions`:

- Enter natural language descriptions
- AI generates complete policy configurations
- Best for complex policies or when you want AI to handle the details

### Conditions Mode

Access via `/assistant/conditions`:

- Visual condition builder interface
- More control over individual conditions
- Best when you know exactly what conditions you need

## Chat Interface for Policy Refinement

After the initial policy is generated:

- Continue the conversation to refine the policy
- Ask for modifications: "Make the limit $5,000 instead"
- Request additions: "Also add a time window restriction"
- The AI maintains context throughout the conversation

## Policy Simulation and Testing

Test policies before deployment:

- Use the "Simulate" tab in the sidebar
- Enter sample payloads
- See how the policy evaluates the payload
- View evaluation traces and results

## Expression Editor (Payload Editing)

Advanced users can edit condition expressions directly:

- Use the "Payload" tab to view and edit raw condition expressions
- Modify expressions for fine-grained control
- See how changes affect the policy structure

## Thread Management and Conversation Continuity

- Each conversation has a unique thread ID
- Threads maintain context across multiple messages
- You can return to previous conversations
- Policy configurations are linked to their threads

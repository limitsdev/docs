Agents are the AI systems that perform actions in your application. While the SDK focuses on policy evaluation, agents are managed through the [Limits Dashboard](https://app.limits.dev) or the REST API.

## Agent Management

Agents are registered and configured through:

- **Dashboard**: [app.limits.dev](https://app.limits.dev) - Visual interface for managing agents
- **REST API**: Programmatic access to agent management endpoints

The SDK is designed for policy evaluation at runtime, not agent management. When checking policies, you reference policies by their policy key, not by agent.

## Using Policies with Agents

When your agent needs to perform an action, use the SDK to check policies:

```typescript
import { Limits } from "@limits/sdk";

const limits = new Limits({
  apiKey: process.env.LIMITS_API_KEY,
});

// Check conditions before agent action
const decision = await limits.checkConditions('amount-minimum-usd', {
  amount: 500,
  currency: 'USD',
  // Include any agent context in the conditions
});

if (decision.isBlocked) {
  // Prevent the agent from performing the action
  console.error('Action blocked:', decision.data.reason);
} else if (decision.isEscalated) {
  // Wait for human approval
  console.warn('Action requires approval:', decision.data.reason);
} else {
  // Proceed with the agent action
  console.log('Action allowed:', decision.data.reason);
}
```

## Policy Keys

Policy keys are identifiers for your policies (e.g., `'amount-minimum-usd'`, `'block-amount-under-9000'`). These are configured in the dashboard and associated with your agents.

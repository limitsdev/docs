Policies are deterministic rules that govern what actions your agents can perform. Unlike prompt-based constraints, policies are versioned, auditable, and guaranteed to execute consistently.

## Checking Policies

Before an agent performs an action, check if the policy allows it:

```typescript
const result = await limits.check({
  agent: "support-bot",
  action: "send_email",
  context: {
    recipient: "user@example.com",
  },
});

if (result.allowed) {
  // Action is permitted
} else {
  console.log("Blocked:", result.reason);
}
```

## Policy Response

The `check` method returns a policy decision:

```typescript
interface PolicyResult {
  allowed: boolean;
  reason?: string;
  policyId: string;
  policyVersion: string;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

## Human Approval

For sensitive actions, you can require human approval:

```typescript
const result = await limits.check({
  agent: "finance-bot",
  action: "transfer_funds",
  context: {
    amount: 10000,
    currency: "USD",
  },
});

if (result.requiresApproval) {
  // Wait for human approval via dashboard or Slack
  const approved = await limits.waitForApproval(result.approvalId);
}
```

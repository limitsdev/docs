description: "Limits REST API for policy evaluation and human approvals"
---

The Limits API lets you evaluate policies and manage human approval workflows programmatically. All endpoints require API key authentication.

## Base URL

```
https://api.limits.dev
```

## Authentication

All requests must include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create and manage API keys in the [Platform API Keys](/platform/api-keys) page.

## Endpoints Overview

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/policies/{policyKey}/evaluate` | Evaluate a policy against a request payload |
| GET | `/api/human-approvals` | List all human approval requests for your organization |
| GET | `/api/human-approvals/{policyId}` | List human approvals filtered by policy ID |
| POST | `/api/human-approvals/approve` | Approve a pending human approval request |
| POST | `/api/human-approvals/decline` | Decline a pending human approval request |

Use the **Policies** and **Human Approvals** sections in the sidebar to open each endpoint’s reference page: parameters, request/response schemas, and example requests.

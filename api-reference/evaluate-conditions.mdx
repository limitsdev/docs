title: "Evaluate conditions"
description: "Evaluate a conditions policy with structured input"
openapi: "api-reference/openapi.yaml POST /api/policies/{policyKey}/evaluate/conditions"
---

Evaluates a **conditions** policy by key. Send a JSON body with `request.input` as an object (e.g. amount, currency, user fields). The API returns an envelope with `meta` (code, message, errors) and `result` (violated, decision, reason, key).

**Response shape**

- `meta.code` — HTTP status code
- `meta.message` — Status message (e.g. Success, Policy evaluation failed)
- `meta.errors` — Array of validation or evaluation error messages when present
- `result.violated` — Whether the policy was violated
- `result.decision` — ALLOW, BLOCK, or ESCALATE
- `result.reason` — Human-readable reason (optional)
- `result.key` — Policy key that was evaluated

**Example response**

```json
{
  "meta": { "code": 200, "message": "Success", "errors": [] },
  "result": {
    "violated": false,
    "decision": "ALLOW",
    "reason": "Amount is within limits",
    "key": "amount-minimum-usd"
  }
}
```

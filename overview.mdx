---

Limits is a platform for **governing AI and agent requests** in your applications. You define policies that decide, for each request, whether to **allow**, **block**, or **escalate** to human approval—so agents and LLMs stay within the rules you set, without hard-coding logic in every service.

## Why Limits?

Building with AI and agents introduces risks that are hard to manage with code alone:

- **Agents and LLMs can take actions** that shouldn't be allowed—spend, data access, or out-of-scope operations—without a central place to enforce rules.
- **Hard-coding rules in application code** is brittle, doesn't scale across teams or products, and mixes business policy with implementation.
- **Manual review doesn't scale**; you need consistent, automated policy enforcement with the option to escalate to humans when it matters.
- **Visibility is missing**: what was allowed, what was blocked, what needed approval, and why.
- **API, SDK, and backend services** need the same policy layer so behavior is consistent everywhere.

Limits gives you one policy layer: define rules once, enforce them across your stack, and keep full visibility and control.

## How it works

<img src="/images/overview-flow.png" alt="Limits: one policy layer for allow, block, escalate" />

Requests from your stack (API, SDK, agents, webhooks, or manual triggers) hit the Limits policy layer. Limits evaluates each request against your policies and returns **allow**, **block**, or **escalate**—so the same rules apply everywhere.

### You define policies, not just code

Policies live in the Limits platform. You describe **when** to allow, block, or escalate using **conditions** (e.g. request amount, user risk, resource type), and optionally **instructions** that guide the system. You can start from natural language in the **Assistant** ("Block requests over $10,000" or "Escalate when risk is high"), then refine in the visual editor—no need to hand-write policy logic in every service.

Policies are evaluated for every request; the outcome is **allow**, **block**, or **escalate** to human approval.

### Three outcomes: Allow, Block, Escalate

Every request is evaluated against your policies:

| Outcome | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Allow** | The request is permitted. |
| **Block** | The request is denied. |
| **Escalate** | The request is sent to human approval; you decide in the **Approvals** queue. |

**Priority:** Block overrides Escalate, Escalate overrides Allow. You define conditions in the visual condition builder.

### One policy layer across your stack

Use the same policies everywhere. Create **API keys** in Limits, then call the Limits API or SDK from your app or backend—one source of truth and consistent behavior across your stack.

### You stay in control

- **Dashboard** — Active policies, pending approvals, and counts of approved/blocked requests.
- **Policies** — Create and edit policies (conditions and instructions); use the Assistant to generate from natural language and simulate before deploying.
- **Logs** — Filter and search action logs for full auditability.
- **Approvals** — Handle escalated requests in one place.

## Policies do what you tell them

You control the logic: simple rules, conditional workflows, or complex multi-step behavior.

**Simple rule:**

- Block any request where `request.amount > 10000`.
- Allow all other requests.

**Conditional workflow:**

- If `user.risk_level == 'high'`: escalate to human approval.
- If `request.amount > 5000`: escalate to human approval.
- Otherwise: allow.

You define the conditions and instructions; Limits evaluates every request and returns allow, block, or escalate—and logs it all.
